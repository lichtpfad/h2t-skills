# Autonomous run — <<title>>

> **Durable spine (autonomous run, <<today>>).** Survives context compaction / blocker.

## Durable-spine header

Authorized: autonomous delivery through handoff. On a **hard-stop or unresolvable blocker**
→ run `h2t-core:handoff` — NOT on a default-shaped decision (those are auto-resolved, see
Decision-protocol). Verify the branch before every commit.

## Where things are

- Branch: `<<branch>>`
- Spec: `<<spec_path>>`
- Issue: <<issue>>
- Tests: `<<venv_test>>`
- e2e applicability: <<e2e_state>>

## Pipeline steps

<<pipeline_rows>>

## Gates

- Codex review-gate after each milestone/checkpoint AND at the end (embedded content,
  read-only). GATE FAIL if any `[P1]`.
- Council finish-gate at the end (codex + >=2 Opus lenses) -> SOUND / blockers.
- pre-merge-check before PR.
- `N_gate_attempts` = 2. One attempt = one fix edit + one gate/test re-run.

## Decision-protocol

Auto-resolve ONLY allow-listed, reversible decisions (library/API call shape; formatting/
naming within conventions; test-fixture values; doc wording): research best-practice ->
pick -> append to Decision-log -> continue. Escalate everything else.

Hard-stops (stop -> eligible WIP-commit -> handoff; never auto-resolve):
- **Irreversible / destructive** (delete/force-push, merge to main, external publish/send,
  deleting/modifying pre-existing untracked files).
- **Money / budget** (paid runs, token budget over limit, council/codex beyond cost-gate).
- **Scope / architecture change** (deviation from approved spec, new invariant, redefined goal).
- **Gate not fixable in** `N_gate_attempts`.

## Execution principles

Verify branch before every commit; `git mv`/`git rm` only; never delete/modify pre-existing
untracked files (creating this run's own artifacts is allowed). One command per Bash call.
Frequent small commits. Codex subagents one-at-a-time, never parallel.

## Blocker / fail-safe protocol

Record the blocker + what was tried -> eligible WIP-commit (stage only intentional files,
never `git add -A`, never commit a red suite as green, message `WIP:` + what was left) ->
`h2t-core:handoff`. Never force a broken merge or a false-green.
